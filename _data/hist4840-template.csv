Out of this grieving process has come my victory over death, a richer appreciation and love of life. In struggling with this process, I realized that i needed to place something by our son's grave to assert my presence and caring. Every parent knows the joy of watching their children grow and blossom continuously before their eyes. For this reason it is important to place something which adequately represents this wonderous process. So, a Serviceberry was planted in memory of our son. Out of that, I realized that the recognition of the dignity of life was central to the grieving process and with the help of friends, I decided to create a Children's Garden as a memorial to all the children buried there. Most plants were selected to represent our seasons, and would create a garden that, like children, will always be growing and changing. Several plants were chosen because they provide food for birds, representative of the fact that all living things are interdependent and have a place.
